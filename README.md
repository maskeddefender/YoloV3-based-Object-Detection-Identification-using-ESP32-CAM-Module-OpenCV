YoloV3-based Object Detection & Identification using ESP32 CAM Module & OpenCV

Introduction
This project implements real-time object detection and identification using the ESP32 CAM module and the YoloV3 algorithm, leveraging the power of OpenCV. The integration of cvlib and TensorFlow further enhances the system's efficiency and accuracy.

Features
Real-Time Detection: Utilizes YoloV3 for real-time object detection and identification.
High Accuracy: Advanced image processing using OpenCV improves detection accuracy.
Efficient Integration: Combines ESP32 CAM hardware with robust computer vision algorithms.
Enhanced Capabilities: Leveraged cvlib and TensorFlow for model deployment and improved performance.
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

ESP32 CAM module
Micro USB cable
A computer with Arduino IDE installed
Python 3.x installed on your system
Required Python libraries: opencv-python, cvlib, tensorflow
Installation
Clone the Repository:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/YoloV3-based-Object-Detection-Identification-using-ESP32-CAM-Module-OpenCV.git
cd YoloV3-based-Object-Detection-Identification-using-ESP32-CAM-Module-OpenCV
Install the Required Libraries:

sh
Copy code
pip install opencv-python
pip install cvlib tensorflow
Hardware Setup
Connecting the ESP32 CAM Module:
Connect the ESP32 CAM to your computer using a micro USB cable.
Follow the instructions here for detailed connection setup.
Configuration
Arduino IDE Configuration:

Install the ESP32 board package in Arduino IDE.
Open the Arduino IDE and select the appropriate board and port.
Upload the sketch to the ESP32 CAM module.
Python Script Configuration:

Ensure the Python script is correctly configured with your ESP32 CAM module's IP address.
Update the yolov3.cfg and yolov3.weights paths in the script.
Running the Project
Starting the Detection:

Run the Python script:
sh
Copy code
python object_detection.py
Viewing the Results:

The script will start capturing video from the ESP32 CAM and perform object detection in real-time.
Detected objects will be displayed with bounding boxes and labels.
Usage
Customizing Detection: Modify the object_detection.py script to change detection parameters, confidence thresholds, or to add custom object classes.
Saving Results: The script can be configured to save detection results as images or videos for further analysis.
Troubleshooting
Connection Issues: Ensure the ESP32 CAM module is properly connected and configured in the Arduino IDE.
Library Errors: Verify all required Python libraries are installed and compatible with your Python version.
Performance: For improved performance, consider optimizing the YoloV3 model or using a more powerful hardware setup.
